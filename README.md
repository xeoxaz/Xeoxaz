### Bio
I am an ethical security hacker, often referred to as a white hat hacker. 🛡️

*I navigate networks silently, leaving no trace.* 🥷

My toolkit includes scanners, exploit frameworks, and cryptographic skills—each meticulously chosen for the task at hand. 🛰️

*If I find something, I'll let you know.* 😉

With a custom web ui.

###### Cosmic Blue (Minecraft plugin)
I most likly won't ever put it on github, but it's a all in one plugin for my custom minecraft server.
