### About me
I am an ethical security hacker, often referred to as a white hat hacker. 🛡️

*I navigate networks silently, leaving no trace.* 🥷

My toolkit includes scanners, exploit frameworks, and cryptographic skills—each meticulously chosen for the task at hand. 🛰️

*If I find something, I'll let you know.* 😉

## Projects

#### [Website](https://xeoxaz.com/)
I love to code css, creating front end interfaces are my speciality.
I took on a new challange of making music, and making a website like myspace/soundcloud!

#### [Orbit](https://github.com/xeoxaz/Orbit_Server)
A more recent project, Linking client computers to the skynet.
With a custom web ui.

#### Cosmic Blue (Minecraft plugin)
I most likly won't ever put it on github, but it's a all in one plugin for my custom minecraft server.
