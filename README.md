## Project Showcase

### [a2](https://github.com/xeoxaz/a2)
This project is a simple yet powerful web server built with Bun and TypeScript that displays live system metrics on a clean, modern webpage.  
📈 **Why a2?** Because peeking at your CPU and RAM should feel like scrolling Instagram—fast, clean, and a little addictive. The server leverages Bun for blazing speed and TypeScript for catching those “oopsies” before they become bugs. It’s perfect if you love dashboards, hate bloat, and want to know what your system is doing (besides plotting against you).

### [Xeoxaz](https://github.com/xeoxaz/Xeoxaz)
It's Me!  
🤓 The digital shrine to my existence: a repository for personal experiments, dotfiles, oddball scripts, and whatever else I decide deserves to be immortalized in source control. Think of it as my nerdy playground—sometimes chaotic, always interesting. If you want to see what weirdness I’m cooking up next, this is the place.

### [XeoClip2](https://github.com/xeoxaz/XeoClip2)
◈ A high-performance screen recording tool optimized for Windows 64-bit.  
🎥 **XeoClip2** is what happens when you’re tired of bloated, laggy screen recorders. Built with performance in mind, it squeezes out every frame and byte, letting you record your screen with minimal fuss and maximum quality. Perfect for gamers, educators, or anyone who wants to capture their desktop shenanigans without their PC sounding like a jet engine.

### [XeoClip](https://github.com/xeoxaz/XeoClip)
Custom FFMPEG Screen Recorder  
🚀 This is the OG XeoClip: a minimal screen recorder with all the quirks and hacks you’d expect from a custom FFMPEG wrapper. Designed for those who want total control over their recordings (and aren’t afraid of the command line). If you love tweaking settings and squeezing out every last bit of performance, welcome home.

### [RAWR](https://github.com/xeoxaz/RAWR)
Zen Patched Kernel Sources  
🐾 **RAWR** isn’t just a sound—it’s a state of mind. This project houses my custom-patched Linux kernel sources, tuned for maximum Zen and minimum nonsense. For the adventurous who like their OS howling at the moon and running smoother than a caffeinated cheetah. Kernel compilation: not for the faint of heart, but oh-so-satisfying.
